3 | const fn to_bar(foo: Array) -> impl Sized {
  |                 --- move occurs because `foo` has type `[String; 4]`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
4 |     konst::destructure!{[bar, baz, qux @ ..] = foo}
  |                                                --- value moved here

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
